# BoxBreathing

## Introduction
Life can get busy, stressful and chaotic at times. In those moments, it’s important to remember to not focus on external forces, but to instead focus on our inner energy. Mindful breathing can help people de-stress, slow down the nervous system, increase concentration and many other physiological and psychological benefits. However, some people have difficulty focusing on their breath and struggle with mindful breathing. This program will provide visual cues for the box breathing technique, and allow people to follow along with their breath to assist them in their mindful breathing practice.
