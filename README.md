# BoxBreathing

## Introduction
Life can get busy, stressful and chaotic at times. In those moments, it’s important to remember to not focus on external forces, but to instead focus on our inner energy. Mindful breathing can help people destress, slow down the nervous system, increase concentration and many other physiological and psychological benefits. However, some people have difficulty focusing on their breath and struggle with mindful breathing. This program will provide visual cues for the box breathing technique, and allow people to follow along with their breath to assist them in their mindful breathing practice.


## How to Use
When the program starts, users will need to input how many rounds of mindful breathing they would like to do. One round consists of four seconds of inhalation, four seconds of holding the breath, four seconds of exhalation, and a final four seconds of holding the breath.

Once the number of rounds is inputted, the user will be prompted to type the word 'start' when they are ready to start their practice.

When the user initials the rounds of breathing, the program will provide prompts to let the user know what action they should be focusing on (i.e. - “breath in”) followed by a counter that will count down the seconds until the action is completed (i.e. “4, 3, 2, 1, 0”).

At the end of the practice, users will have the option to initate additional rounds of breahthing if they choose, otherwise they can choose to end the program.
